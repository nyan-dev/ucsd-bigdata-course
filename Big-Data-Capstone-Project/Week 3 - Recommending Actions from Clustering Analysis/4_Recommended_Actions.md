| *Target specific lower cost promo/discounts for Cluster 2.*| Cluster 2: Customers that are very active and generate a moderate amount of revenue. If we could make them buy a bit more with cheaper prices, we could take advantage of their habit. |
| *Target specific higher cost premium features for Cluster 1.*| Cluster 1: Customers that are very cash convertible with ads even if they play a moderate amount, generating a high amount of revenue. These guys like to spend their money, even if they arenâ€™t playing all the time. They are probably older and have a day job. We should target premium features and personalize adds so that they are aware and can spend their cash. |
